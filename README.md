# Subdomain-Enumeration-Tool
This project is a multithreaded Subdomain Enumeration Tool written in Python. Its primary purpose is to identify valid subdomains of a given target domain (e.g., youtube.com) by checking for live HTTP responses. Subdomain enumeration is a critical step in reconnaissance for penetration testing and cybersecurity analysis.
